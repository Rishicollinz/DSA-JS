3.5:Automated testing-7/2/24
=====================
Automated testing means that tests are written separately, in addition to the code. They run our functions in various ways and compare results with the expected.

=>Behavior Driven Development:
===================

Three things: test,documentation and examples.

1.Creation of spec:
like this function is for what, what it does and expected output;

E.g:
describe("pow", function() {

  it("raises to n-th power", function() {
    assert.equal(pow(2, 3), 8);
  });

});

Explanation:
describe("title", function() { ... })
it("use case description", function() { ... })
assert.equal(value1, value2)


2.Mocha:
========
 the core framework: it provides common testing functions including describe and it and the main function that runs tests.

 before()=>to display before test;
 after()=>after test display;

 beforeEach()=>display before every it.
 afterEach()=>display after every it.

3.Chai:=for assertions.
========


4.1:Object:=7/2/24
===========

=> key can't be keywords.This is known as property names limitations.

property existence test,in:
==========================

=>we can whether a object has a specific prop(key);

syntax:"key" in object

for...in loop:
=============
for (key in object) {
  // executes the body for each key among object properties
}

Order in objects:
=================

->if property(keys) in obj are ints, then they are sorted otherwise like string they are in creation order;


4.2:Object references and copying:
=================================

let a={an obj};
let b=a;

=>Here,b is not a new one, it links the a's reference.
=>Any change here will change the original.

here a==b because of same reference or memory.

let a={},b={};
here a!==b(bcoz both are different objects);

=>Const objects can be modified.

copying:creates an extra reference to the same obj;

cloning:
========
->Naive method(for...each)

=>Object.assign(dest,source1,source2);

eg:
let user = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30
};

let clone = {}; // the new empty object

Object.assign(clone,user);
clone.name="rishi";
console.log(user);
console.log(clone);

output:

{ name: 'John', age: 30 }
{ name: 'rishi', age: 30 }

*.Structured clone:
To fix that and make user and clone truly separate objects, we should use a cloning loop that examines each value of user[key] and, if it’s an object, then replicate its structure as well. That is called a “deep cloning” or “structured cloning”. There’s structuredClone method that implements deep cloning.

let user = {
  name: "John",
  sizes: {
    height: 182,
    width: 50
  }
};

let clone = structuredClone(user);

alert( user.sizes === clone.sizes ); // false, different objects

// user and clone are totally unrelated now
user.sizes.width = 60;    // change a property from one place
alert(clone.sizes.width); // 50, not related

4.3:Garbage Collection:
=======================
=>If a variable isn't reachable, then this will junk the data and frees the memory;

*.Unreachable island

*.The basic garbage collection algorithm is called "mark and sweep";

*.Mark and sweep:
like parent node -> Child node -> leaf node(in a loop);

*.when there is no leaf to mark, it checks for reachability and removes the unreachable codes.

optimizations:
->Generational Collection:new and old elements.

->Incremental Collection:
big code->spilt to small module code->many garbage collection. to reduce delay

->Idle time collection: garbage collection runs only when the cpu is idle.

4.4:Object methods,"this"
===========================

=>this keyword:
===============

let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,

  sayHi() {
    // "this" is the "current object"
    alert(this.name);
  }

};

user.sayHi(); // John
=>this is used to access values from the same class like block.

=>this is not bound:
e.g:
function sayHi() {
  alert( this.name );
}

it can run based on the context of the calling obj;

=>Arrow functions don't have this.


4.5:Constructor, operator"new":
=================
Eg:
function User(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.isAdmin = false;
}

let user = new User("Jack");

alert(user.name); // Jack
alert(user.isAdmin); // false

Def:
The regular {...} syntax allows us to create one object. But often we need to create many similar objects, like multiple users or menu items and so on.

That can be done using constructor functions and the "new" operator.


constructor function:
=====================

Optional chaining:
==================
The optional chaining ?. stops the evaluation if the value before ?. is undefined or null and returns undefined.
let user = {}; // user has no address

alert( user?.address?.street );

Symbol type:
=============
->A object can have symbol or string as keys.
->It is a unique identifier;

let id=Symbol();

->It is always unique;

usage ex:
let user = { // belongs to another code
  name: "John"
};

let id = Symbol("id");

user[id] = 1;

alert( user[id] ); // we can


->Instead of using the id as string and defining. it will be added to user obj and can be accessed everywhere but symbol can't be accessed by others.

=>Symbols are skipped by for...in loop.

=>Symbol.for("id")=>if there is already a symbol, it is used but if there is not, it is created.

Object to primitive conversion:
====================
hints:
    ->number
    ->String
    ->default

*.[Symbol.toPrimitive]

*.toString/valueOf




1.Datatypes:=6/2/24
============

1.1: Primitive Datatypes:
=========================
1.All the primitive datatypes are primitive in js.
2.Primitive is lightweight and fast but each primitive(string...) may have inbuilt functions.
3.All functions are objects and objects are heavyweight.
4.To solve this, In JS, a object wrapper is wrapped around datatypes.
5.This wrapper has inbuilt functions upon executing its functions, it is destroyed.

1.2: Number:
============

1.2.1.use 'e':
==========

->For positive:
        ->let a=100000; can be represented as 1e5(5 zeros 1*10000);
->For negative:
        ->let a=0.00005; can be represented as 1e-5(5 zeros before 1/10000 );

1.2.2.Hex num:= 0xff//255 as num
1.2.3.Binary num:=0b11111111//255 as num
1.2.4.Octal num:=0o377//255 as num

1.2.5:toString(base):
=====================
->It is used to convert num to its specific base.
->By default, num is base=10

->let a=255;
    a.toString(8//16//2//10//32)(//octal//hexdec//binary//decimal//for url)

    for directly using num:
    255..toString(use double decimal bcoz single decimal means float value);

1.2.6:Rounding:
===============
    ->Math.round=3.7 as 4
    ->Math.ceil=3.1 as 4 and -3.1 as -3
    ->Math.floor=3.6 as 3 and -3.6 as -4
    ->Math.trunc=3.625 as 3

    ->toFixed(n):The method toFixed(n) rounds the number to n digits after the point and returns a string representation of the result.

            let num = 12.34;
            alert( num.toFixed(1) ); // "12.3" it is string

1.2.7:->isFinite() and isNaN();
=========================
->Number.isFinite() and Number.isNaN()// they are strict version which checks the datatypes too.
1.2.8
->Object.is(a, b) is the same as a === b.

1.2.9:ParseInt and parseFloat:
=================================

*.These read the value until they can't

let a=10.25pt;

parseFloat(25.25$)//op:25.25(when $ encountered it can't read so stops); similar for parseInt;

parseFloat(num,radix); 
->radix is base 2,8,10,16//converts the num to its base like decimal,binary representation.

1.2.10:Other Math functions:
===========================

->Math.random();
->Math.min,max,pow;

1.3:Strings:
===========
1.3.1.usage of backslash(escape character):
=============================================
\\ for single \;
\' or \" for ' or "

.length= is a property which displays the length of the string

        
1.3.2.Accessing characters:
==========================

->str.at(pos);//it also -ve values.
    e.g:str.at(-1)//last character; str.at(-2) means last before character;
->str[pos];

*.Strings are immutable

*.toUpperCase();toLowerCase()
=============================

*.indexOf():
    let str = 'Widget with id';

    alert( str.indexOf('id', 2) ) // 12
    indexOf(str,pos);
*.lastIndexOf(str,pos):
    ->Searches from the end.

*.includes(str,pos)=>pos is the pos to start the search;

*.startsWith(str) and endsWith(str);

substring:
==========

*.slice(start, end)->from start to end (not including end)->allows negatives

*.substring(start, end)->between start and end (not including end)->negative values mean 0->start can be greater than end

*.substr(start, length)->from start get length characters->allows negative start

Comparing strings:
===================

*.codePointAt(0)=>displays the decimal number for any character

*.fromCodePoint(90)=>z 

*.localeCompare():
    The call str.localeCompare(str2) returns an integer indicating whether str is less, equal or greater than str2 according to the language rules:

    Returns a negative number if str is less than str2.
    Returns a positive number if str is greater than str2.
    Returns 0 if they are equivalent.

5.4:Array:
==========

->arr.at(-1):displays the last element;

=>arr.shift()=>Removes the first element of Array
=>arr.push()=>adds the element at the end
this can be used for queue...

=>arr.pop()=>Removes the element from the end

=>arr.unshift()=>Adds element to the front of Array

=>Push and unshift can add multiple elements at once;

=>Array is an object so that's why arr[0] works.

=>push and pop is fast, shift and unshift are slow.

=>for..of loop in array,

=>we can truncate the array by reducing the arr.length;

=>Don't compare array with == or ===. compare by item by items.

5.5 Array methods:
==================

=>arr.push()
=>arr.pop()
=>arr.shift()
=>arr.unshift()

delete an element in array:

=>arr.splice:is used for deletion,insertion in array;

=>arr.splice(startpos,deleteCount,insertVals);

E.g:
Deletion:
let arr = ["I", "study", "JavaScript", "right", "now"];

// remove 3 first elements and replace them with another
arr.splice(0, 3, "Let's", "dance");

alert( arr ) // now ["Let's", "dance", "right", "now"]
Insertion:
1.let arr = ["I", "study", "JavaScript"];

// from index 2
// delete 0
// then insert "complex" and "language"
arr.splice(2, 0, "complex", "language");

alert( arr ); // "I", "study", "complex", "language", "JavaScript"

=>arr.slice
=>arr.concat(arguments..arr..value);

=>foreach in array:
arr.forEach(function(item, index, array) {
  // ... do something with item
});

Searching in array:
==================

=>arr.indexOf,lastIndexOf,includes.

=>arr.find(fn):
let result = arr.find(function(item, index, array) {
  // if true is returned, item is returned and iteration is stopped
  // for falsy scenario returns undefined
});

Eg:let users = [
  {id: 1, name: "John"},
  {id: 2, name: "Pete"},
  {id: 3, name: "Mary"}
];

let user = users.find(item => item.id == 1);

alert(user.name); // John


=>arr.findIndex(fn);//returns index or -1

=>arr.findLastIndex(fn);//returns last index

=>arr.filter(fn);
e.g:
let users = [
  {id: 1, name: "John"},
  {id: 2, name: "Pete"},
  {id: 3, name: "Mary"}
];

// returns array of the first two users
let someUsers = users.filter(item => item.id < 3);

alert(someUsers.length); // 2

arr.map:
========
It calls the function for each element of the array and return the array of results.

E.g:
let lengths = ["Bilbo", "Gandalf", "Nazgul"].map(item => item.length);
alert(lengths); // 5,7,6

map(callbackfn: (value: number, index: number, array: number[]) => any, thisArg?: any): any[]
A function that accepts up to three arguments. The map method calls the callbackfn function one time for each element in the array.


Calls a defined callback function on each element of an array, and returns an array that contains the results.

=>map(callbackfn: (value: number, index: number, array: number[]) => any, thisArg?: any): any[]
A function that accepts up to three arguments. The map method calls the callbackfn function one time for each element in the array.
=>Calls a defined callback function on each element of an array, and returns an array that contains the results.

arr.sort():
============

=>default sort is alphabet sort(lexicographic);

function compareNumeric(a, b) {
  if (a > b) return 1;
  if (a == b) return 0;
  if (a < b) return -1;
}

let arr = [ 1, 2, 15 ];

arr.sort(compareNumeric);

alert(arr); 

=>arr.reverse():reverses the array;

*.arr.split(delim):it is used to split a string or something based on the delimitor.

*.arr.join(adder):It is opposite to split;

=>arr.reduce(accumulator,item,index,array):
same as map where each val calls a fn but the results ar added to accumulator for each time.

Eg:
let arr=[1,2,3,4,5];
let r=arr.reduce((sum,curr)=>{
    return sum+=curr;
},0)
console.log(r);

op:15

=>arr.reduceRight(): same as reduce but goes from right to left.

.isArray():checks whether it is array or not;

=>arr.some()//checks for first truthy(||);

=>arr.every()//checks for first falsey(&&);

=>arr.fill(value, start, end);

=>The copyWithin() method of Array instances shallow copies part of this array to another location in the same array and returns this array without modifying its length.
